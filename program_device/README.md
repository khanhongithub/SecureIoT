# Flash sensortag from command line

The following script can be used for programming.

Supported file types of the program:

- .hex
- .elf

Usage:

```bash
./flash_prog.sh <filename>
```

## Troubleshooting / Additional information

- During the lab you need more then one Sensortag connected to the PC. Make sure you program the one you intended.  There is no chance to select between the connected Sensortags, so you have to __connect only the one you want to program__.
- After programming you have to __reset the Sensortag__. This can be done by pressing the reset button on the rear side of the debugger!
