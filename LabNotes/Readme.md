# LAB Report/Diary

__Each student__ has to create a lab diary __individually__. Use the supplied template in this folder.
The purpose of the report/diary is the following:
- Identify the individual tasks done by __each__ team member
- Set the focus of the oral exam to the task each team member has performed.

So it is in your own interest to have a detailed diary, you don't have to write things like "Added three lines in fileA...".
Please don't write me emails with things like "How detailed do we have to write the dairy?". In question think about if you would need the information if you had to grade the Lab. If still in question write it down.
